# Bharat Intern Internship Tasks

Throughout the duration of my internship at Bharat Intern Internship, I engaged in two impactful projects that enriched my understanding of machine learning. These tasks were diverse, offering distinct challenges and learning opportunities. They provided a focused and enriching experience, contributing significantly to my practical knowledge in the field.

## Task 1 - House Price Prediction
Created Python-based machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression) for predicting house prices, with the Linear Regression model delivering superior results.

## Task 3 - Iris Classification 
Developed an Iris flower classification model using Logistic Regression in Python, aimed at accurately classifying iris flowers based on their distinctive features.
